https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/20newsgroups-mld/20newsgroups.data.html

The codes in this project learn to predict the correct newsgroup an article belongs to after it has been trained using Naive-Bayes Classifier. There are 2 files:
> 1. Data has been preprocessed and the naive-bayes algorithm has been coded. The algorithm used is the one given in 'table 6.2' of 'Machine Learning by tom Mitchell' 
> 2. Data has been vectorised using Count Vectoriser and Tfidf Vectoriser. after that sklearn classifiers have been used.
